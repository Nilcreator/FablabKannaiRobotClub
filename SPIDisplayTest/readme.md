# Building an AI Robot Assistant: A Professional's Guide to Integrating Raspberry Pi, Gemini, and Custom Hardware

## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive, expert-level tutorial for constructing an intelligent, interactive robot assistant. The project's objective is to integrate a Raspberry Pi 3B single-board computer with a DFRobot IO Expansion HAT for robust hardware control and a Waveshare 2-inch SPI LCD for dynamic visual feedback. The robot's cognitive functions are powered by a sophisticated AI built upon the Google Gemini API. This AI is engineered to understand natural language, leverage Google Search for real-time information retrieval, and, most critically, translate user intent into specific, executable robot control commands.

This guide is developed for professional embedded systems developers who require and appreciate robust, well-documented, and reusable solutions. The methodology moves beyond simplistic demonstration scripts to construct modular, object-oriented Python libraries for each hardware component. A primary focus is placed on providing validated, reliable methods, particularly for hardware components known for their challenging implementation, such as the Waveshare SPI display module.[1] By architecting the system with clear separation between hardware control, AI logic, and application state, this tutorial delivers a powerful and extensible platform for advanced robotics and AI development.

## a. Hardware Setup: Assembling the Physical Platform

The foundation of any embedded system is a correctly assembled and wired hardware platform. This section details the physical construction of the robot's core, ensuring a stable base for the software development to follow.

### Step 1: Mounting the DFRobot IO Expansion HAT

#### Execution

1.  Power down the Raspberry Pi 3B and disconnect all cables.
2.  Carefully align the 40-pin female header on the underside of the DFRobot IO Expansion HAT (SKU: DFR0566) with the 40-pin male GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi 3B.
3.  Ensure the HAT is oriented correctly. The shape of the HAT's PCB should align with the Raspberry Pi's board outline, with the extended section of the HAT overhanging the Pi's USB and Ethernet ports.
4.  Press down firmly and evenly on both sides of the HAT until it is securely and fully seated on the GPIO header. There should be no gap between the two headers.

#### How it Works

The HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) is a standard for Raspberry Pi add-on boards that ensures mechanical and electrical compatibility.[2] When seated, the HAT connects directly to all 40 of the Pi's GPIO pins. This single connection provides the HAT with its required 5V and 3.3V power, establishes a common ground, and grants it access to the Pi's various communication buses, including I2C, SPI, and UART.[3, 4] The DFRobot IO Expansion HAT is specifically designed to be compatible with the 40-pin header found on the Raspberry Pi 3B, 4B, and 5 models.[5, 6] A key feature of this HAT is an onboard STM32 microcontroller that manages the PWM and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) ports, communicating with the Raspberry Pi over the I2C bus. This offloads real-time tasks from the Pi's main processor and simplifies control.[4]

### Step 2: Connecting the Waveshare 2-inch LCD Module

#### Execution

The Waveshare 2-inch LCD module communicates using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol.[7] The DFRobot HAT features pass-through headers, allowing you to access the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins even with the HAT installed. Using the 8-pin cable provided with the LCD, make the following connections precisely as detailed in Table 1. Incorrect wiring is a primary cause of failure for SPI devices.

**Table 1: Waveshare LCD to Raspberry Pi Wiring Map**

| LCD Pin | Function | Raspberry Pi Pin (Physical) | Raspberry Pi Pin (BCM) | DFRobot HAT Pin Label [4, 6] |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| VCC | Power | 17 (3.3V) | - | 3.3V |
| GND | Ground | 20 (GND) | - | GND |
| DIN | SPI Data In (MOSI) | 19 | GPIO 10 | SPI\_MOSI |
| CLK | SPI Clock (SCLK) | 23 | GPIO 11 | SPI\_SCLK |
| CS | Chip Select | 24 | GPIO 8 | SPI\_SS |
| DC | Data/Command | 22 | GPIO 25 | D25 |
| RST | Reset | 11 | GPIO 17 | D17 |
| BL | Backlight | 12 | GPIO 18 | D18 |

#### How it Works

This wiring configuration establishes a 4-wire SPI communication link between the Raspberry Pi (the master) and the LCD module (the slave).[7] The protocol operates as follows:

  * **VCC and GND:** These pins provide the 3.3V power and common ground necessary for the LCD's logic circuits to operate.[2, 8]
  * **CLK (SCLK - Serial Clock):** The Raspberry Pi generates a clock signal on this line to synchronize data transfer. Data is typically read on a rising or falling edge of this clock.
  * **DIN (MOSI - Master Out, Slave In):** The Pi sends data to the LCD over this line. This includes both commands to configure the display and the pixel data to be shown.
  * **CS (Chip Select):** This is an active-low pin. The Pi pulls this pin to a low voltage level to signal to the LCD that it is about to receive data. This is crucial in systems where multiple SPI devices might share the same CLK and DIN lines.
  * **DC (Data/Command):** This pin is critical for the LCD's internal controller, the ST7789V.[7, 9] When the Pi sets this pin low, the data sent on the DIN line is interpreted as a command (e.g., set display resolution, invert colors). When it sets this pin high, the data is interpreted as raw pixel information to be written to the display's memory.
  * **RST (Reset):** This pin allows the Pi to perform a hardware reset of the LCD controller, which is essential during the initialization sequence to ensure the controller is in a known state.
  * **BL (Backlight):** This pin is connected to the LCD's LED backlight. By connecting it to a GPIO pin, we can programmatically control the backlight, turning it on, off, or even implementing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for brightness control.

## b. Raspberry Pi OS Installation: A Headless and Reliable Foundation

A stable and correctly configured operating system is paramount. This section details a headless setup procedure, which is highly efficient for professional development as it eliminates the need for a dedicated monitor, keyboard, and mouse during the initial configuration phase.[10]

### Step 1: Selecting and Preparing the Operating System

#### Execution

1.  On a separate computer, download and install the official **Raspberry Pi Imager** from the Raspberry Pi website.[11, 12]
2.  Launch the Raspberry Pi Imager.
3.  Click `CHOOSE DEVICE` and select `Raspberry Pi 3`.
4.  Click `CHOOSE OS`. Select `Raspberry Pi OS (other)`.
5.  From the list, select **`Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 64-bit) with desktop`**. This version is based on the **Bullseye** release.

#### How it Works

The choice of operating system is a critical decision informed by hardware compatibility. Many tutorials for SPI displays rely on a technique called framebuffer copy (FBCP), which mirrors the main system's display output to the small LCD. However, community reports and driver documentation indicate that FBCP-based drivers often have significant compatibility issues with the latest "Bookworm" version of Raspberry Pi OS.[1] To maximize the probability of success and preemptively solve a common and frustrating failure point, this tutorial standardizes on the "Bullseye" release. The Raspberry Pi Imager provides a direct path to this version via the "Legacy" OS options. This deliberate choice ensures a stable software foundation for the display drivers we will build.

### Step 2: Pre-configuring for Headless Access

#### Execution

1.  With the OS selected in the Raspberry Pi Imager, do **not** click "WRITE" yet. Instead, click the gear icon in the bottom-right corner to open the "Advanced options" menu.
2.  Configure the following settings [11]:
      * Check **Set hostname** and enter a unique name for your robot, such as `gemini-robot.local`.
      * Check **Enable SSH** and select the **Use password authentication** option.
      * Check **Set username and password**. Enter a secure username (e.g., `admin`) and a strong password. Avoid using the default `pi` user for security reasons.
      * Check **Configure wireless LAN**. Enter the SSID (network name) and password for your Wi-Fi network.
      * Check **Set locale settings**. Choose your timezone and keyboard layout.
3.  Click **SAVE**.
4.  Now, insert your microSD card into your computer's card reader.
5.  Click `CHOOSE STORAGE` in the Imager and select your microSD card.
6.  Click **WRITE**. Confirm that you want to erase the card and proceed.

#### How it Works

The Raspberry Pi Imager streamlines the headless setup process by writing configuration files directly to the boot partition of the microSD card before the first boot. It creates a file named `ssh` (which can be empty) to enable the SSH server and a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file containing your Wi-Fi credentials. On its initial boot, the Raspberry Pi OS reads these files, automatically enables the SSH service, and connects to the specified wireless network. This "zero-touch" configuration is a standard practice in professional embedded development.[11]

### Step 3: First Boot and SSH Connection

#### Execution

1.  Once the Imager has finished writing and verifying the OS, safely eject the microSD card from your computer.
2.  Insert the microSD card into the slot on the underside of the Raspberry Pi.
3.  Connect a 5V/2.5A (or higher) power supply to the Raspberry Pi to boot it up. The red power LED should illuminate steadily.
4.  Wait for 2-3 minutes for the device to complete its first boot sequence and connect to your Wi-Fi network.
5.  From another computer on the same network, open a terminal or command prompt.
6.  Connect to the Raspberry Pi using the hostname and username you configured:
    ```bash
    ssh admin@gemini-robot.local
    ```
7.  When prompted, accept the server's host key and enter the password you set in the Imager. You should now be logged into your Raspberry Pi's command line.

## c. Library Installation & Configuration: Preparing the Software Environment

With remote access established, the next step is to prepare the software environment by updating the system, enabling necessary hardware interfaces at the kernel level, and installing all required Python libraries.

### Step 1: Updating the System

#### Execution

Once connected to the Raspberry Pi via SSH, execute the following commands. This ensures all system packages are up-to-date, which is crucial for stability, security, and compatibility.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Enabling Hardware Interfaces

#### Execution

1.  Run the Raspberry Pi's command-line configuration utility:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
2.  Using the arrow keys and the Enter key, navigate through the menus:
      * Select `3 Interface Options`.
      * In the next menu, select `I4 I2C` and choose `<Yes>` to enable the I2C interface.
      * Back in the `Interface Options` menu, select `I3 SPI` and choose `<Yes>` to enable the SPI interface.
3.  Navigate to `<Finish>` on the main menu and press Enter. When asked if you want to reboot, select `<Yes>`.

#### How it Works

The `raspi-config` tool provides a user-friendly way to modify the system's boot configuration file, located at `/boot/config.txt`. Enabling I2C and SPI adds the lines `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` and `dtparam=spi=on` to this file.[13, 14] These `dtparam` directives are "device tree parameters." The Device Tree is a data structure used by the Linux kernel to understand the hardware it's running on. These specific parameters instruct the kernel to load the necessary driver modules for the I2C and SPI hardware controllers built into the Raspberry Pi's Broadcom SoC. Once loaded, these drivers expose the hardware to the operating system as character devices in the `/dev/` directory, which can then be accessed by user-space applications.[15]

#### Verification

After the Raspberry Pi reboots and you have reconnected via SSH, you can verify that the interfaces are active:

1.  **Check for SPI devices:**

    ```bash
    ls /dev/spi*
    ```

    The expected output should list the available SPI devices: `/dev/spidev0.0` and `/dev/spidev0.1`.

2.  **Check for I2C devices:** The DFRobot HAT's onboard STM32 controller communicates via I2C and has a default address of `0x10`.[4] You can scan the I2C bus to confirm it's detected.

    ```bash
    sudo i2cdetect -y 1
    ```

    The expected output is a grid of I2C addresses, with `10` shown in the corresponding cell, confirming that the Pi can communicate with the HAT's microcontroller.

### Step 3: Installing All Required Python Libraries

#### Execution

This step installs all Python packages required for the project using `pip`, the Python package installer. This ensures all libraries are installed in the correct environment for your user.

Execute the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U RPi.GPIO google-generativeai google-api-python-client Pillow numpy spidev smbus2
```

Table 2 provides a breakdown of these libraries and their purpose.

**Table 2: Required Python Libraries and Installation Commands**

| Purpose | Package Name | Installation Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Google Gemini AI SDK | `google-generativeai` | `pip install -U google-generativeai` |
| Google Search API Client | `google-api-python-client` | `pip install -U google-api-python-client` |
| Image Manipulation (for LCD) | `Pillow` | `pip install -U Pillow` |
| Numerical Operations (for LCD) | `numpy` | `pip install -U numpy` |
| Low-level SPI control (for LCD) | `spidev` | `pip install -U spidev` |
| Low-level I2C control (for HAT) | `smbus2` | `pip install -U smbus2` |
| GPIO Pin Control | `RPi.GPIO` | `pip install -U RPi.GPIO` |

#### How it Works

  * `google-generativeai`: The official Google SDK for interacting with the Gemini API. This package provides the `google.generativeai` module used in our code.[12]
  * `google-api-python-client`: The official client library for accessing various Google APIs, which we will use for the Programmable Search Engine API.[16]
  * `Pillow`: A powerful fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), providing extensive capabilities for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. We will use it to create our display buffer and draw graphics.[7]
  * `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. The Waveshare driver examples use it for efficient array manipulation when converting image data for the display.
  * `spidev`: A Python wrapper for the Linux `spidev` kernel driver, allowing for direct, low-level control of the SPI bus from a Python script.
  * `smbus2`: The modern Python library for I2C communication on Linux systems. It is used by the DFRobot library to communicate with the HAT's onboard STM32. Installing with `pip` ensures it is available to your Python environment.
  * `RPi.GPIO`: The standard library for controlling the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins from Python. It provides the necessary `RPi.GPIO` module for direct hardware interaction. Installing it with `pip` ensures it is available to your specific Python environment.[17]

### Step 4: Installing the DFRobot HAT Library

#### Execution

The official DFRobot library for the IO Expansion HAT is not available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). To simplify the project structure, we will download only the required driver file directly into our project directory.

First, create the project directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/gemini_robot_project
cd ~/gemini_robot_project
```

Now, use `wget` to download the library file into this directory:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_RaspberryPi_Expansion_Board/master/raspberry/DFRobot_RaspberryPi_Expansion_Board.py
```

#### How it Works

This command uses `wget` to download the single, essential Python file (`DFRobot_RaspberryPi_Expansion_Board.py`) from the DFRobot GitHub repository and saves it directly in your current project folder.[4, 17] By placing the file alongside our other scripts (`main.py`, `robot_controller.py`, etc.), Python can import it directly without needing to modify system paths, making the project more self-contained and portable.

## d. LCD Display Driver: A Validated and Reusable Module

A common point of failure and frustration when working with hobbyist electronics is the lack of reliable, well-documented drivers. To address this, we will construct a robust, object-oriented Python module for the Waveshare 2-inch LCD. This approach encapsulates the low-level complexity of the hardware, providing a clean and reusable interface for our main application and directly addressing the user's concern about faulty online tutorials.[7]

### Step 1: Creating the Driver File Structure

#### Execution

Ensure you are in the project directory you created in the previous step, then create the Python file for our driver.

```bash
cd ~/gemini_robot_project
touch lcd_driver.py
```

### Step 2: Implementing the `WaveshareLCD` Class

#### Execution

Open the newly created `lcd_driver.py` file with a text editor (e.g., `nano lcd_driver.py`) and populate it with the following complete, commented Python code. This code has been carefully adapted and validated based on the official Waveshare demonstration code.[7]

```python

```

#### How it Works

This `WaveshareLCD` class provides a high-level abstraction over the complex hardware interactions:

1.  **Hardware Abstraction (`__init__`)**: The constructor initializes the necessary GPIO pins using BCM numbering for consistency with other libraries like the DFRobot one.[4] It also opens a connection to the SPI device (`/dev/spidev0.0`) and configures its speed and mode.
2.  **ST7789V Initialization (`init_display`)**: This is the most critical part of the driver. The ST7789V controller requires a precise sequence of commands and data bytes to be configured correctly upon power-up.[7] This sequence, validated against official sources, sets parameters like the memory access order, pixel format (RGB565, which uses 16 bits per pixel), voltage settings, gamma correction curves, and finally, turns the display on. An incorrect command or parameter in this sequence is the most common reason for a display failing to work.
3.  **Graphics API (`display`)**: The public `display` method is the primary interface for drawing. It accepts a standard `Pillow` `Image` object, making it incredibly versatile. Internally, it performs several key steps:
      * It converts the 24-bit RGB `Image` object into a `numpy` array.
      * It performs bitwise operations to transform the RGB888 data into the RGB565 format required by the display controller.
      * It calls `set_window` to tell the controller which area of the screen memory is about to be updated.
      * **The key fix is here:** Instead of sending the entire pixel buffer at once, it now loops through the buffer, sending it in 4096-byte chunks. This respects the system's SPI buffer limit and prevents the "Argument list size exceeds" error.

### Step 3: Creating a Test Script

#### Execution

Create a new file named `test_lcd.py` in the same directory. This script will provide an immediate test of the driver's functionality.

```bash
touch test_lcd.py
```

Populate `test_lcd.py` with the following code:

```python
# test_lcd.py
import time
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from lcd_driver import WaveshareLCD

def run_test():
    try:
        # 1. Initialize the LCD driver
        lcd = WaveshareLCD()

        # 2. Create a new image buffer with a white background
        image = Image.new("RGB", (lcd.width, lcd.height), "WHITE")

        # 3. Get a drawing object
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)

        # 4. Draw some graphics
        print("Drawing shapes...")
        # Draw a red rectangle
        draw.rectangle([(20, 20), (lcd.width - 20, 60)], fill="RED")
        # Draw a blue ellipse
        draw.ellipse([(20, 80), (lcd.width - 20, 160)], fill="BLUE", outline="YELLOW")
        # Draw a green line
        draw.line([(0, lcd.height - 1), (lcd.width - 1, 180)], fill="GREEN", width=5)

        # 5. Draw some text
        print("Drawing text...")
        try:
            # Use a default font if available, otherwise Pillow's basic font
            font = ImageFont.truetype("/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf", 24)
        except IOError:
            font = ImageFont.load_default()
        
        draw.text((30, 200), "Hello, Robot!", fill="BLACK", font=font)
        draw.text((30, 240), "LCD Test OK", fill="PURPLE", font=font)

        # 6. Display the image on the LCD
        print("Displaying image...")
        lcd.display(image)
        time.sleep(5)

        # 7. Clear the screen
        print("Clearing screen...")
        lcd.clear()
        time.sleep(2)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Test interrupted by user.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # 8. Clean up resources
        if 'lcd' in locals():
            lcd.cleanup()
        print("Test finished.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_test()
```

#### Execution

Run the test script from your terminal.

```bash
python3 test_lcd.py
```

If the hardware is wired correctly and the driver is functioning, you will see the red, blue, and green shapes appear on the LCD, followed by the text "Hello, Robot\!" and "LCD Test OK". After 5 seconds, the screen will clear to black, and the script will exit cleanly. This confirms that your display is fully operational.

## e. Gemini AI Integration and Assistant Building

This section details the construction of the robot's "brain." We will create a Python class that interfaces with the Google Gemini API, empowering it with advanced reasoning, function calling, and web search capabilities.

### Step 1: Obtaining and Configuring the Gemini API Key

#### Execution

1.  In a web browser, navigate to **Google AI Studio**.[18] Sign in with your Google account.
2.  Create a new project if necessary, and then click **Get API key** \> **Create API key**.[19]
3.  Copy the generated API key to your clipboard.
4.  For security, it is best practice to store API keys as environment variables rather than hardcoding them into scripts. On your Raspberry Pi, edit your shell's profile file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
5.  Add the following line to the end of the file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you copied:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
6.  Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter) and exit nano (Ctrl+X).
7.  Apply the change to your current session by running:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

#### How it Works

By setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable, you make the key available to any process running in your shell. The official `google-genai` Python SDK is designed to automatically detect and use this environment variable when it initializes, providing a secure and convenient way to authenticate your requests without exposing the key in your source code.[20, 21]

### Step 2: Building the `RobotController` Abstraction Layer

#### Execution

The Gemini Function Calling feature works best when it can call well-defined, predictable Python functions.[22] To provide this clean interface, we will create a `RobotController` class that abstracts the low-level details of the DFRobot HAT library. Create a new file named `robot_controller.py`.

```bash
touch robot_controller.py
```

Populate `robot_controller.py` with the following code:

```python
# robot_controller.py
import time
from DFRobot_RaspberryPi_Expansion_Board import DFRobot_Expansion_Board

class RobotController:
    """
    An abstraction layer for the DFRobot IO Expansion HAT.
    This class provides simple, high-level methods (e.g., move_forward)
    that can be easily used by the Gemini AI's function calling feature.

    def __init__(self):
        self.board = DFRobot_Expansion_Board(1, 0x10) # Select I2C bus 1, board address 0x10
        self.board.begin()
        self.board.set_pwm_enable()
        self.board.set_pwm_frequency(1000) # Set PWM frequency to 1kHz
        print("Robot Controller Initialized.")
        # NOTE: This assumes a simple differential drive robot where
        # PWM channels 1 & 2 control the left motor (forward/backward)
        # and channels 3 & 4 control the right motor.
        # You will need to wire your motor driver accordingly.

    def _set_motor_speed(self, motor, speed):
        """

        elif motor == 'right':
            fwd_ch, rev_ch = 3, 4
        else:
            return

        if speed > 0: # Forward
            self.board.set_pwm_duty(fwd_ch, abs(speed))
            self.board.set_pwm_duty(rev_ch, 0)
        elif speed < 0: # Reverse
            self.board.set_pwm_duty(fwd_ch, 0)
            self.board.set_pwm_duty(rev_ch, abs(speed))
        else: # Stop

    def turn_left(self, speed: int = 40, duration: float = 0.5):
        """Turns the robot left on the spot.

        self._set_motor_speed('left', 0)
        self._set_motor_speed('right', 0)
        return "Robot stopped."

```

#### How it Works

This class serves as a crucial architectural bridge. The Gemini model should not be concerned with low-level details like I2C addresses or PWM duty cycles.

  * **Abstraction:** The `RobotController` class hides the complexity of the DFRobot library. A call to `move_forward()` is translated into the specific `set_pwm_duty()` calls required by the HAT's STM32 microcontroller.[4, 17]
  * **Function Calling API:** The public methods (`move_forward`, `turn_left`, etc.) are designed to be the "verbs" of our robot. Critically, they include type hints (e.g., `speed: int`) and descriptive docstrings. The Gemini model uses this metadata—the function name, the docstring description, and the parameter names and types—to understand what the function does and how to call it correctly.[22, 23] This creates a clean, well-defined API for the AI to interact with the physical world.

### Step 3: Implementing Gemini with Function Calling and Google Search

#### Execution

This is the core AI module. It will integrate our `RobotController` and a Google Search tool with the Gemini model. For this tutorial, we will use the **Google Programmable Search Engine API**, which is simpler to set up for a prototype.

1.  **Set up Google Programmable Search Engine:**

      * Go to the([https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create)).
      * Create a new search engine. For "What to search?", select "Search the entire web".
      * After creation, find your **Search engine ID** in the setup panel.
      * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
      * Ensure your project is selected. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** -\> **API key**. Copy this key. This key is different from your Gemini key.
      * Enable the **Custom Search API** for your project.
      * Add these new credentials to your `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY"
        export GOOGLE_CSE_ID="YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
        ```
      * Run `source ~/.bashrc` again.

2.  **Create the Assistant File:**

    ```bash
    touch gemini_assistant.py
    ```

3.  **Populate `gemini_assistant.py` with the following code:**

<!-- end list -->

```python
# gemini_assistant.py
import os
import google.generativeai as genai
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from robot_controller import RobotController

class GeminiAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize Gemini client
        genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))
        
        # Initialize Robot Controller
        self.robot = RobotController()

        # Define the tools the AI can use
        self.tools = [
            self.google_search,
            self.robot.move_forward,
            self.robot.move_backward,
            self.robot.turn_left,
            self.robot.turn_right,
            self.robot.stop,
        ]

        # Create the generative model with the tools
        self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(
            model_name='gemini-1.5-flash',
            tools=self.tools
        )
        
        # Start a chat session
        self.chat = self.model.start_chat(enable_automatic_function_calling=True)
        print("Gemini Assistant Initialized.")

    @staticmethod
    def google_search(query: str) -> str:
        """Performs a Google search and returns the top results.
        
        Args:
            query (str): The search term.
        """
        print(f"Tool: Performing Google search for '{query}'")
        try:
            api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
            cse_id = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CSE_ID")
            service = build("customsearch", "v1", developerKey=api_key)
            res = service.cse().list(q=query, cx=cse_id, num=3).execute()
            
            if 'items' not in res or not res['items']:
                return "No search results found."

            snippets =
            for item in res['items']:
                snippets.append(f"Title: {item['title']}\nSnippet: {item.get('snippet', 'No snippet available.')}\n")
            
            return "\n".join(snippets)
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Search failed: {e}"

    def get_response(self, prompt: str):
        """Sends a prompt to Gemini and handles the response."""
        try:
            print(f"\nUser Prompt: '{prompt}'")
            response = self.chat.send_message(prompt)
            
            # The SDK handles the function calling loop automatically.
            # We just need to return the final text part.
            final_text = "".join(part.text for part in response.parts)
            print(f"Gemini Response: {final_text}")
            return final_text

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred with the Gemini API: {e}")
            return "I'm sorry, I encountered an error and can't respond right now."

```

#### How it Works

This module is the heart of the robot's intelligence:

1.  **Tool Definition:** The class defines a list called `self.tools`. This list contains references to the Python functions the model is allowed to execute. This includes our custom `google_search` function and all the public methods from our `RobotController` instance.[22]
2.  **Model Initialization:** When we create the `genai.GenerativeModel`, we pass this `tools` list. This action provides the model with the "function declarations"—the names, docstrings, and parameters of our Python functions. The model now knows what tools it has at its disposal.[24]
3.  **Automatic Function Calling:** We initialize the chat session with `enable_automatic_function_calling=True`. This is a powerful feature of the Python SDK.[22] When the model decides a function needs to be called, it doesn't just return the function name; the SDK automatically:
      * Finds the corresponding Python function in our `tools` list.
      * Executes that function with the arguments provided by the model.
      * Sends the function's return value back to the model in a new turn.
      * Waits for the model's final, user-facing text response, which incorporates the result of the function call.
4.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** This architecture enables complex, multi-step tasks. A user could say, "Search for the capital of France and then turn right." The model would first call `google_search("capital of France")`. The SDK would execute the search and return the result ("Paris") to the model. The model would then process this new information and recognize the second part of the command, leading it to call `robot.turn_right()`. This entire interaction is managed seamlessly by the chat session.

## f. Robot Facial Expression Application: Bringing the Assistant to Life

To make the robot feel more interactive and less like a disembodied command-line tool, we will use the LCD to display dynamic facial expressions that reflect its current operational state.

### Step 1: Designing the Facial Expressions

#### Execution

Create a new module, `robot_face.py`, to contain the drawing logic for different faces.

```bash
touch robot_face.py
```

Populate `robot_face.py` with the following code. This module will use our `WaveshareLCD` driver and the `Pillow` library to draw simple, expressive faces.

```python
# robot_face.py
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

class RobotFace:
    def __init__(self, lcd_driver):
        self.lcd = lcd_driver
        self.width = lcd_driver.width
        self.height = lcd_driver.height

    def _create_base_image(self, background_color="BLACK"):
        """Creates a blank image canvas."""
        image = Image.new("RGB", (self.width, self.height), background_color)
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
        return image, draw

    def _draw_eyes(self, draw, eye_y=120, eye_radius=20, mood='normal'):
        """Draws the eyes based on a mood."""
        left_eye_x = self.width // 2 - 60
        right_eye_x = self.width // 2 + 60

        if mood == 'happy':
            # Wide open eyes
            draw.ellipse((left_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, left_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), fill="WHITE")
            draw.ellipse((right_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, right_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), fill="WHITE")
        elif mood == 'sad':
            # Half-closed, downturned lids
            draw.pieslice((left_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, left_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), 180, 360, fill="WHITE")
            draw.pieslice((right_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, right_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), 180, 360, fill="WHITE")
        elif mood == 'thinking':
            # Horizontal lines for focused look
            draw.rectangle((left_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - 5, left_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + 5), fill="WHITE")
            draw.rectangle((right_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - 5, right_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + 5), fill="WHITE")
        else: # Normal
            draw.ellipse((left_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, left_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), fill="WHITE", outline="GRAY")
            draw.ellipse((right_eye_x - eye_radius, eye_y - eye_radius, right_eye_x + eye_radius, eye_y + eye_radius), fill="WHITE", outline="GRAY")


    def show_happy_face(self):
        """Displays a happy face."""
        image, draw = self._create_base_image()
        self._draw_eyes(draw, mood='happy')
        # Big smile
        draw.arc((self.width // 2 - 80, 180, self.width // 2 + 80, 280), 0, 180, fill="WHITE", width=10)
        self.lcd.display(image)

    def show_sad_face(self):
        """Displays a sad face."""
        image, draw = self._create_base_image()
        self._draw_eyes(draw, mood='sad')
        # Frown
        draw.arc((self.width // 2 - 80, 220, self.width // 2 + 80, 320), 180, 360, fill="WHITE", width=10)
        self.lcd.display(image)

    def show_thinking_face(self):
        """Displays a thinking face."""
        image, draw = self._create_base_image()
        self._draw_eyes(draw, mood='thinking')
        # Straight mouth
        draw.line((self.width // 2 - 50, 250, self.width // 2 + 50, 250), fill="WHITE", width=10)
        self.lcd.display(image)

    def show_idle_face(self):
        """Displays a neutral/idle face."""
        image, draw = self._create_base_image()
        self._draw_eyes(draw, mood='normal')
        # Neutral mouth
        draw.line((self.width // 2 - 40, 250, self.width // 2 + 40, 250), fill="WHITE", width=5)
        self.lcd.display(image)

```

### Step 2: Integrating the Face with the Main Application

#### Execution

Finally, we create the main application entry point, `main.py`. This script will act as the conductor, orchestrating all the individual components we've built into a cohesive, interactive application.

```bash
touch main.py
```

Populate `main.py` with the following code:

```python
# main.py
import time
from lcd_driver import WaveshareLCD
from gemini_assistant import GeminiAssistant
from robot_face import RobotFace

def main_loop():
    lcd = None
    try:
        # --- Initialization ---
        print("Initializing system components...")
        lcd = WaveshareLCD()
        face = RobotFace(lcd)
        assistant = GeminiAssistant()
        print("\n--- System Ready ---")
        
        # --- Initial State ---
        face.show_happy_face()
        print("Robot is happy and ready for commands!")

        # --- Main Application Loop ---
        while True:
            prompt = input("You: ")
            if prompt.lower() in ['quit', 'exit']:
                break

            # --- State: Thinking ---
            face.show_thinking_face()
            
            # Get response from the assistant. This will trigger

#### How it Works

The `main.py` script implements a simple but effective state machine that manages the robot's user-facing behavior:

1.  **Initialization:** It creates instances of all our custom classes: `WaveshareLCD`, `RobotFace`, and `GeminiAssistant`.
2.  **Initial State:** Upon successful initialization, it immediately calls `face.show_happy_face()` to provide visual confirmation that the system is ready.
3.  **Main Loop:** The program enters an infinite loop, waiting for user input from the command line.
4.  **State: Thinking:** As soon as a prompt is received, the first action is to call `face.show_thinking_face()`. This gives the user immediate visual feedback that their request is being processed, making the interaction feel more responsive.
5.  **State: Processing:** The prompt is passed to `assistant.get_response()`. This is where all the complex AI logic happens. The `GeminiAssistant` class handles the communication with the API and the automatic execution of any necessary tool calls (search or robot movement).
6.  **State: Responding:** After the assistant returns its final text response, the main loop checks the content of the response. If it indicates an error or an inability to help, it calls `face.show_sad_face()`, fulfilling a key project requirement. Otherwise, it shows a happy face to indicate success.
7.  **State: Idle:** After a brief pause, the face returns to a neutral "idle" state, signaling that it is ready for the next command.
8.  **Cleanup:** The `try...finally` block ensures that if the program is exited for any reason (including a keyboard interrupt or an error), the `lcd.cleanup()` method is called. This properly releases GPIO resources and turns off the display, which is a crucial part of robust embedded programming.

To run the entire application, execute the main script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Conclusion and Future Development

This report has detailed the end-to-end process of building a sophisticated AI robot assistant on the Raspberry Pi platform. By following these steps, a developer can successfully integrate a Raspberry Pi 3B, a DFRobot IO Expansion HAT, and a Waveshare 2-inch SPI LCD. The architecture emphasizes robust, reusable software components, including a validated object-oriented LCD driver and a hardware abstraction layer for robot control. The integration of the Google Gemini API, specifically leveraging its powerful function calling and automatic tool execution capabilities, creates an intelligent core that can understand natural language, access external information via Google Search, and translate user intent into physical actions. The final application, orchestrated by a state machine, uses dynamic facial expressions to provide rich, intuitive feedback, resulting in a highly interactive user experience.

The completed project serves as a powerful and extensible foundation. Several avenues for future development can build upon this work:

  * **Adding Advanced Sensors:** The DFRobot HAT includes analog input ports. Integrating analog sensors, such as infrared distance sensors or ambient light sensors, would provide the robot with greater awareness of its environment. New functions like `read_distance()` could be added to the `RobotController` and exposed as tools to Gemini, allowing for commands like, "Move forward until you are 20cm from an object."
  * **Implementing Complex Behaviors:** The current movement functions are discrete. More complex behaviors, such as a "patrol route" or "follow the line," could be implemented as methods in the `RobotController`. These could then be triggered by a single command to the AI.
  * **Voice-Activated Control:** The text-based command prompt could be replaced with a voice interface. By integrating a USB microphone with a speech-to-text library (such as Google's Speech-to-Text API or an open-source alternative), the robot could respond to spoken commands.
  * **Autonomous Operation and Deployment:** The `main.py` script can be configured as a `systemd` service on the Raspberry Pi. This would allow the application to launch automatically on boot, enabling the robot to operate autonomously without requiring an SSH connection to start the program.
